\section{Connections on Cobordisms}

For a vector bundle $\pi_E : E \to M$, we write $\Gamma(E)$ to denote the set of
smooth sections of the bundle -- we will not be using the sheaf structure unless
necessary. For $\K = \R$ when $E$ is a smooth bundle with a real vector space as
fibres, or $\K = \C$ when $E$ is a complex bundle, we recall that a connection
\cite{Conn} on $E$ is a $\K$--linear map
\[
  \nabla : \Gamma(E) \to \Gamma(E \tensor T^*M)
\]
such that for all $s \in \Gamma(E)$ and $r \in \Cinf(M, \K)$, the following
Leibniz property is satisfied:
\[
  \nabla(r \cdot s) = r \cdot \nabla(s) + s \tensor dr
\]

The right summand requires some clarification.
First, if $r : M \to \R$ is a smooth function, then the derivative of $r$ is a
map $dr : TM \to T\R$ such that $(r, dr)$ is a bundle morphism making the
following diagram in the category of manifolds commute:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
TM \ar[d, "\pi_{TM}" left] \ar[r, "dr" above] & T\R \ar[d, "\pi_{T\R}" right]\\
M \ar[r, "r" below] & \R
\end{tikzcd}\]
By the definition of bundle morphism, $dr$ is linear on fibres so that for each
$x \in M$, $dr$ restricts to a linear map $T_xM \to \R$ and these maps vary
smoothly with $x$, so that $dr$ is a section of $T^*M$. Hence, by an abuse of
notation, we can view $dr$ as the following map:
\[
  dr : M \to T^*M : x \mapsto dr|_{T_xM}
\]

Next, we are treating $s \tensor dr$ as a map $M \to E \tensor T^*M$ which is
not strictly a tensor product of two maps because its domain is not a tensor
product. By $s \tensor dr$, what we really mean is the map:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:conn_tensor}
  x \mapsto s(x) \tensor dr|_{T_xM}
\end{equation}

We will now see that isomorphisms of vector bundles have an action on the
connections on these bundles, leading to a notion of morphism for connections --
a first step in developing a double category of
``parallel transport machinery''.
