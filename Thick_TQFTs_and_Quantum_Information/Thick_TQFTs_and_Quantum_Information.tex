%\section{Future Work}
%
%We can now try to compute whether this is a Frobenius algebra, but at this
%point, we might think of classifying bilinear multiplications on matrix
%algebras. When is a morphism $\M_n \otimes \M_n \to \M_n$ associative, unital,
%dagger Frobenius and normalizable? I am not sure how easy that is.
%
%Then, we can also think about non-associative or non-unital Frobenius structures
%like a coproduct on a Lie algebra that satisfies Frobenius laws, if that is even
%possible. A google search with such terms reveals that these terms do exist
%together in the literature -- I haven't looked deeper than that.
