\section{Introduction}

The monoidal category $2\Thick$ of thick tangles is the monoidal category freely
generated by the composition of the following morphisms \cite{NonCommTQFT}:
\[\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.25]
\pants{0, 0}
\node at (0, -5) {\footnotesize Pair-of-pants};
\capcob{12, 0}

\end{tikzpicture}\]
Consider a planar open string topological quantum field theory
$F : 2\Thick \to \Vect_{\C}$ as defined in \cite{NonCommTQFT}. $F$ is
determined by the images of the above generating structures under $F$. One
possible to way to connect quantum information to topological quantum
field theories is to assume that the image of the interval $I$ under $F$
is some finite dimensional $C^*$ algebra of operators on some Hilbert space of
states. Coecke, Heunen and Kissinger \cite{CatQChan} have shown that every such
algebra is, in fact, a dagger Frobenius algebra, with some additional structure,
so that this assumption on $F$ is valid. In fact, every finite dimensional $C^*$
arises as the image of the interval under such a planar open string field
theory.

It is well-known that finite dimensional $C^*$ algebras, up to $*$--isomorphism,
are finite direct sums of square matrix algebrs $\bigoplus_i \M_{n_i}$ where
$\M_n$ is the set of $n \times n$ matrices with complex entries equipped with
the usual multiplication. For simplicity, we first assume that $F(I)$ is the
$C^*$ algebra $\M_n$. Then, we can consider quantum gates to be elements of
$\M_n$ and circuits to be composition or multiplication of these elements. While
$\M_n$ has all gates necessary for quantum computing for some fixed number of
cubits, there is a major constraint on the elements of $\M_n$ that are in the
image of $F$, as we describe below.

Elements $a \in \M_n$ can be seen maps $\C \to \M_n : z \mapsto za$. The
elements that are accounted for by $F$ are images of thick tangles
$\varnothing \to I$. However, these ``element'' thick tangles are determined by
their genus, since in $2\Thick$ we identity morphisms up to diffeomorphism, so
that all element thick tangles must decompose as follows:
\[\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=0.25]
\cupcob{0, 0}
\copants{4, 0}
\pants{8, 0}
\copants{12, 0}
\pants{16, 0}
\draw[loosely dotted, thick] (18.5, 0) -- (21.5, 0);
\copants{24, 0}
\pants{28, 0}
\end{tikzpicture}\]
where we take the domain of thick tangle to be on the left and the codomain, on
the right. Call this thick tangle $R$. Let $m : \M_n \tensor \M_n \to \M_n$ be
the multiplication of $\M_n$.  Then the multiplicative unit is
$e : \C \to \M_n : z \mapsto zI_n$ and, by the definition of dagger Frobenius
algebra, the comultiplication of $\M_n$ is $m^{\dagger}$. Hence, under $F$, the
element thick tangle above yields a map $(mm^{\dagger})^k e$, where
the superscript $k$ denotes a $k$--fold composite for some non-negative integer
$k$. Now, $mm^{\dagger}$ is the map $a \mapsto na$ \cite[10]{CatQChan}
so that
\[
  F(R)(z) = z \cdot F(R)(1) = z \cdot (mm^{\dagger})^ke(1) = zn^{k}I_n
\]

This shows that the only elements, in the usual sense of elements of $\M_n$,
that are accessible through $F$ are multiples of the identity matrix by powers
of $n$. It is then easy to see that for direct sums such as
$\bigoplus_{i = 1}^{q} \M_{n_i}$, the only accessible elements are
\[
  (n_1^k I_{n_1}, \dots, n_q^k I_{n_q})
\]
so that up to $*$--isomorphism, there are some major constraints on the quantum
gates that are accessible through planar open string field theories.
We note that this situation is brought about by the identification of thick
tangles up to diffeomorphisms. This motivates us to look for methods in a
setting where we drop this identification -- higher categories of thick tangles
(for instance, $\PTT$ as defined in \cite{NonSemiSimp}) (or cobordisms)
where gluing is associative and unital up to higher isomorphisms. We will
see that it suffices to consider double categories for obtaining a reasonable
method for formulating quantum information in terms of topological field
theories.
