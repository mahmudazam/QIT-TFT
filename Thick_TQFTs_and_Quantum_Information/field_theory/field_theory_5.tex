\subsection{Addition of Cobordisms}

We now make precise the notion of addition for $2$--dimensional thick tangles
mentioned in the previous subsection.

Consider $2$--dimensional thick tangles $M : I^{\amalg n} \to I^{\amalg m}$ and
$N : I^{\amalg n'} \to I^{\amalg m'}$. Suppose $S_1 \in \set{S(M), S(N)}$ is the
source of either $M$ or $N$ with the most copies of $I$ and $S_0$ is that with
the least copies of $I$. $T_0, T_1 \in \set{T(M), T(N)}$ are defined
analogously. That is, $S_0 = I^{\amalg \min\set{m, m'}}$ and
$T_0 = I^{\amalg \min\set{n, n'}}$. Then, $M + N$ is defined to be the shape
obtained by gluing $S_0$ to the first $\min\set{m, m'}$ copies of $I$ in
$S_1$ and $T_0$ to the first $\min\set{n, n'}$ copies of $I$ in $T_1$.
