\section{Paths for Parallel Transport}

In order to obtain linear maps by parallel transport on manifolds, we need
additional structure on top of connections. These are collections of paths on
manifolds along which we will parallel transport vectors in the fibres of a
bundle with connection. We shall now formalize this apparatus in terms of
categories. We will require a notion of graphs on manifolds whose vertices are
points, possibly repeated, on the manifold and whose edges are paths on the
manifold.
