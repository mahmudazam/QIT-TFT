\section{Quantum Information}

In this section we discuss a completely categorical formulation of finite
dimensional $C^*$ algebras. This formulation is one of the main results of
\cite{channels} where the authors prove that the category of finite dimensional
$C^*$ algebras is equivalent to a category constructed from a certain class of
Frobenius algebras. Using this formulation, we proceed to outline the connection
of PFTs with $C^*$ algebras and, by extension, quantum information.

%A qubit in quantum information theory is modelled as a variable taking values in
%the complex vector space $\C^2$.\footnote{We are simplifying the description for
%this initial discussion.} A register of length $n$, then, is a variable taking
%values in the $n$--fold tensor product $Q_n := \bigotimes_{i = 1}^n \C^2$. In
%quantum information, we are primarily interested in linear maps
%$\bigotimes_{j = 1}^N Q_{n_i} \to \bigotimes_{k = 1}^M Q_{n_k}$, without getting
%into the details. Now, under the inner product $(a, b) \mapsto \overline{a^T}b$,
%$Q_n$ is a Hilbert space for all $n = 1, 2, \dots$ and, hence, so are tensor
%products $\bigotimes_{j = 1}^N Q_{n_j}$. A standard result in linear algebra is
%that all linear transformations between finite dimensional complex vector spaces
%are bounded and that the space $\s{L}(V) := \Hom_{\Vect_{\C}}(V, V)$ of bounded
%operators on a finite dimensional space $V$ form a $C^*$ algebra with the
%product given by composition and the involution given by the conjugate
%transpose.

%Therefore, the central objects of study in QIT are finite dimensional
%$C^*$ algebras
