\section{Topological Quantum Field Theories}

A topological quantum field theory or TQFT is a functor with some additional
structure from a certain category of manifolds to the category of vector spaces
over some field $\mathbf{k}$. We first make precise what the domain categories
of TQFTs must be but we will only develop the theory to a level sufficient to
arrive at the result we require -- namely that $2$--dimensional topological
quantum field theories are equivalent to a certain class of algebras.

In the following, we take all manifolds to be smooth and oriented, and all
diffeomorphisms to be orientation preserving, unless otherwise stated. For
closed manifolds, $X$ and $Y$, we will write $X \amalg Y$ to denote their
disjoint union. $X^*$ is defined to be the manifold obtained by reversing the
orientation of $X$. We write $I$ to denote the real interal $[0, 1]$. If $X$ has
a boundary, we write $\partial X$ to denote the boundary of $X$. With these
notational conventions we construct the domain category of a TQFT, based on
\cite{Corominas}, \cite{Jorge} and \cite{MayTQFT}.
