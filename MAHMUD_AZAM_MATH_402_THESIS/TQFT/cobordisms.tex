\subsection{Cobordisms}

We first define some fundamental structures arising from manifolds. For $d > 0$
and closed $(d - 1)$--manifolds $X$ and $Y$, let $M$ be a compact $d$--manifold
such that $\partial M = W_0 \amalg W_1$ and $\fn{\iota_0}{X}{M}$ and
$\fn{\iota_1}{Y}{M}$ are smooth maps that are diffeomorphisms onto $W_0$ and
$W_1$, respectively, with the added assumption that $\iota_0$ is
\textit{orientation reversing}\footnote{This is one of the rare situations,
where we assume a diffeomorphism does not preserve orientation.}. It should be
noted that we could take $\iota_0$ to be an orientation preserving
diffeomorphism $X^* \to M$ but this would complicate our notation and diagram
chases later on.

\begin{defn}[{$d$}--Cobordism]
In the above scenario, $(M, \iota_0, \iota_1)$ or simply $M$ is called a
$d$--cobordism or simply a cobordism (when $d$ is clear from context) from $X$
to $Y$, and is denoted as $\fn{(M, \iota_0, \iota_1)}{X}{Y}$ or simply
$\fn{M}{X}{Y}$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Equivalent Cobordisms]\label{cob:equiv}
Let $M$ and $M'$ be compact $d$--manifolds with $\partial M = W_0 \amalg W_1,
\partial M' = W_0' \amalg W_1'$ such that diffeomorphisms
$\fn{\iota_0}{X}{M}, \fn{\iota_1}{Y}{M}, \fn{\iota_0'}{X}{M'},
\fn{\iota_1'}{Y}{M'}$ realize $M$ and $M'$ as cobordisms $X \to Y$. Let
$\fn{f}{M}{M'}$ be a diffeomorphism making the following sqaure commute:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  & X \arrow{dl}[above, xshift=-5pt]{\iota_0} \arrow[dr, "\iota_0'"] & \\
  M \arrow[rr, "f"] & & M'\\
  & Y \arrow[ul, "\iota_1"] \arrow[ur, "\iota_1'" below] &
\end{tikzcd}\]
Then, we say $M$ and $M'$ are equivalent cobordisms $X \to Y$ and write this as
the relation $(M, \iota_0, \iota_1) \eqcob (M', \iota_0', \iota_1')$
or simply $M \eqcob M'$.
\end{defn}

\begin{rmk}
If we only have $\fn{(M, \iota_0, \iota_1)}{X}{Y}$ but a diffeomorphism
$\fn{f}{M}{M'}$ for an arbitrary $d$--manifold $M'$ such that $f$ restricts to
the identity function on $\partial M$, then we must have
$\partial M' = \partial M$. As a result, $M'$ is also a cobordism $X \to Y$
with boundary inclusions $f \circ \iota_i$ for $i = 0, 1$ and $M \eqcob M'$.
\end{rmk}

\begin{thm}
$\eqcob$ is an equivalence relation.
\end{thm}
\begin{proof}
Reflexivity is obvious by taking the identity diffeomorphism and symmetry
follows from taking the inverse of $f$ in the following square:
\[\begin{tikzcd}
  & X \arrow{dl}[above, xshift=-5pt]{\iota_0} \arrow[dr, "\iota_0'"] & \\
  M & & M' \arrow[ll, "f^{-1}"] \\
  & Y \arrow[ul, "\iota_1"] \arrow[ur, "\iota_1'" below] &
\end{tikzcd}\]
which commutes because the square in \ref{cob:equiv} commutes. The following
pasting shows transitivity:
\[\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=large, column sep=large]
  & X
    \arrow{dl}[above, xshift=-5pt]{\iota_0}
    \arrow[d, "\iota_0'"]
    \arrow[dr, "\iota_0''"] &\\
  M \arrow[r, "f"] & M' \arrow[r, "g"] & M''\\
  & Y
    \arrow[ul, "\iota_1"]
    \arrow[u, "\iota_1'"]
    \arrow{ur}[below, xshift=5pt]{\iota_1''} &
\end{tikzcd}\]
\end{proof}

We then define what will be the morphisms of our domain category by updating our
definition of cobordism to refer to the equivalence classes under
$\eqcob$.
\begin{defn}[{$d$}--Cobordism (Class)]
Given a compact $d$--manifold $M$ with $\fn{M}{X}{Y}$ as above, from this point
onwards, we will also call the equivalence class of $M$ under $\eqcob$ a
$d$--cobordism or simply a cobordism from $X$ to $Y$ when $d$ is clear from
context. We continue to write $\fn{M}{X}{Y}$ to mean that the class of $M$ is a
cobordism from $X$ to $Y$.
\end{defn}
